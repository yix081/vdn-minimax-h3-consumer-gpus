"""Pre-v2 -> v2 renames for checkpoint keys and transform-config fields: the single
mapping table, plus the value registries the config schema and the ModelSpec share.

Rule order is load-bearing: `.attn.far.gate.` must fire before the generic
`.attn.far.`, or the gate lands at linear_attention.gate instead of
linear_attention.output_gate. First match wins, exactly one substitution per key.

Keys that match NO rule pass through unchanged. That is not a fallback, it is the
contract: LoRA adapter keys (`.attn.orig.*.lora_A/B.*` on the DiT blocks AND
`token_refiner.refiner_blocks.*.attn.*.lora_A/B.*` -- the refiner is a LoRA target
too) and the meta stamps are already spelled the way v2 wants them.
