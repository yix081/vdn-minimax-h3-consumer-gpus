"""A finer gradient-checkpoint boundary than "one whole DiT block".

Stage B checkpoints each block (diffusers' enable_gradient_checkpointing), so only one
block is ever live — but that one block is expensive: at H3 sequence length the hybrid
block's backward transient is tens of GiB, split between attention, the linear branch
(frame_statistics' contiguous copies are ~1.5 GiB each) and the MLP (fc1's output
alone is several GiB in bf16).

All of that is live simultaneously because the checkpoint boundary sits outside the
whole block. Putting a second boundary around `attn` and `ff` means that when the MLP
is being backwarded the attention's intermediates have already been discarded, and vice
versa: the peak becomes max(attn, ff) instead of attn + ff. The outer per-block
checkpoint STAYS — without it the block's residual/modulation intermediates would be
retained at every depth, which is far worse.

    split_block_checkpoints(model)      # after build_model, before fully_shard

Patches `forward` rather than wrapping the module in a new parent, so module identity,
parameter names and every isinstance check keep working — `hybrid_new_parameters` and
`iter_hybrids` both walk `block.attn` expecting a HybridAttention, and checkpoint
keys must not gain a level.
