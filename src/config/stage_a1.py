"""A1: the ONE stage that creates the hybrid architecture from YAML.
Every later stage inherits the architecture from a checkpoint, so every later schema
simply lacks the `model.architecture` section -- an override attempt is an unknown
field, refused by the loader before any model exists.

The architecture block shares its layout with the ModelSpec. A1's lr is one linear
ramp over the whole run (warmup_steps == max_steps by default): annealing is A2's job.
