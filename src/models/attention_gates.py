"""OutputGate: the sigmoid gate BOTH branches put on their output.

Shared on purpose -- the softmax side instantiates it per-head (init 0.99: the softmax
branch IS the teacher at step 0) and the linear side per-channel with init="random" (a live
low-rank path from step 0, matching fla's g_proj).

class OutputGate(nn.Module):
    """Sigmoid gate on a branch's output, zero-initialised so it starts at `init_value`.

    Both branches gate their output, but at different granularity:

      SOFTMAX (head_dim=None) one value per (token, head), broadcast over channels. The
            windowed softmax renormalises to 1 no matter how little mass it saw, so this
            gate scales the softmax branch back toward the share it captured — a scalar
            property of a DISTRIBUTION, hence per-head. Starts at 0.99: the softmax
            branch IS the teacher at step 0.
      LINEAR  (head_dim set)  one value per (token, head, channel): a routing decision on
            a new pathway. Low rank (bottleneck = head_dim by default).

    The init matters, especially on the linear branch: to_out_linear and every writer
    feeding the scan reach the loss ONLY through this gate, so the optimiser's cheapest
    descent direction is to close it and starve them all at once. A constant init near
    sigmoid(0.5) is the point of maximum gate mobility and invites exactly that collapse;
    `init="random"` (linear-branch gate) instead keeps torch's default init on both
    linears, matching fla's g_proj — a LIVE low-rank path, input-dependent from step 0.
    The softmax gate always uses `init="constant"`: it is the mixing gate between the
    two branches (no fla analogue) and its 0.99 is what keeps the softmax branch at the
    teacher on step 0.
