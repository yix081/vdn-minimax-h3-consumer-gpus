    Eager this is a noticeable share of the linear branch for arithmetic that is pure
    bandwidth: the readout is [F*S, H, d] = ~1.4 GiB at H3 scale, and the norm, the
    gate product and the multiply each walk all of it and write all of it back. One
    kernel reads it once.

    `fhsd=True` takes the readout as [F, H, S, d] and folds the transpose back to token
    order into the store: with q kept in [F,H,S,d] the readout is a plain batched
    matmul instead of an einsum that permutes q in and the result out, and the epilogue
    was writing a full copy anyway. The two layouts are BITWISE equal -- both spellings
    do the same multiplies on the same values, only the traversal order differs.

    NOT BITWISE against the eager spelling -- inductor keeps the reciprocal and the two
    multiplies in fp32 and rounds once at the store. Same class of difference as
    `_qk_prep`, and in the same direction (fewer roundings, not more), which is why
    the training body keeps the eager one: a teacher whose job is to be numerically
    comparable to a student must not quietly get the better arithmetic.
