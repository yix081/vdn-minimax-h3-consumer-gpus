    cudnn's NHWC depthwise-2D and Inductor-fused temporal shifts. That is more than an
    order of magnitude cheaper per projection. SANA-WM ships the same factorization.

    Layout: ZERO copies end to end. The token layout [F*S, C] read as [T, H, W, C]
    IS the channels_last memory format of [T, C, H, W], so the cudnn NHWC conv
    consumes a permute VIEW; its channels_last output permutes back to [T, S, C]
