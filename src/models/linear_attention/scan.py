    at the sequence ends have no neighbour on one side; the index is clamped so the
    gather stays in range and the contribution is then masked to zero (a vectorised
    gather cannot skip elements).

    `bridge` chooses how those two states reach frame t:

      "alpha"  multiply in prod_u alpha_u over the frames in between: advance the
               recurrence through the window while pretending those frames wrote
               nothing — which, for this branch, they did not (softmax covers them, so

               cost of making the output gate relearn the overall gain — and the gate is
               the most collapse-prone part of the module. The bridge is NOT a constant

    side: it gets the text state, decayed in over exactly the frames between the
    boundary and t — the same arithmetic the interior rows get, since the scans' virtual
    index -1 (forward) and F (reverse) both hold it. Without it (text_state=None) the ends
    contribute nothing, which is the original complement-of-the-window semantics.

    The whole block is vectorised over frames on purpose: a per-frame python loop
    builds one autograd node per frame per direction, and their backward — not the
    forward — dominates the linear branch's training cost.
