        bounds: per-frame inclusive softmax-window [lo, hi] (see window_bounds).
        frame_size: patched (height, width) of a frame — required iff short_conv is on.
        skip_ends: the partner of HybridAttention.anchor_frames == "both". The softmax side
            makes frames 0 and F-1 exact in both directions, so this branch drops them
            from its INPUT entirely -- not "scanned but ignored" -- and their readout
            rows are exactly zero (softmax and branch stay an exact partition). With
            the two frames gone the window bounds rebase by one: the complement of
            [lo, hi] inside frames 1..F-2 is [1..lo-1] u [hi+1..F-2], i.e.
            gather_linear_state's own arithmetic on (lo-1, hi-1); windows touching a
            clip end get an empty side, which has_before/has_after already handle.
        text_x / text_qkv_raw: the prompt rows. Supplying them turns the branch from
            "the video the window cannot see" into a text-conditioned recurrence: BOTH
            directional scans start from half the text state instead of from zero, so
            every frame's state is a prompt memory that video has written over, and the
            boundary rows read the prompt instead of reading nothing.

            Each direction starts from TEXT_STATE_SCALE (= 0.5) * S_text because
            both carry the SAME prompt and the gather adds them: half each keeps the sum
            at roughly one copy of the prompt, while the per-frame video injections —
            one direction each — stay at full weight.

            This is deliberately NOT the exact complement of the softmax window any
            more: the softmax already sees every text row densely, so the prompt is now
            read twice, once exactly and once as a recurrent state. That is the point of
            the change — the linear branch is being given a condition, not a missing input.

        NOTHING here is arithmetic: the anchor case is a slice, a rebase and a scatter,
        and both cases then run the SAME `_readout`. That split is deliberate — see the
        comment on _readout for why the boundary between the two lives exactly here.

        everything below (state banks, autograd-shaped choices) would, so it sits here.
        Keeping the prune and the scatter next to each other in `forward` also means an

        Selected by `forward(..., inference=True)`; never by ambient grad state.

        TWO differences from `_readout`, and nothing else:

          1. the scan writes into preallocated banks (`_run_scans_inference`) -- same
             ops in the same order, BITWISE equal, half the live memory;
          2. the norm and the output gate go through one compiled kernel
             (`linear_epilogue`) -- several passes of pointwise work on a ~1.4 GiB
             tensor collapsed to one, and NOT bitwise, because inductor rounds once
             where eager rounds after every op (~1e-3 relative, in the accurate
             direction).

        Everything else is a verbatim copy on purpose rather than one body taking an
        `inference` flag. The flag chooses BETWEEN the two bodies, at the top; a flag
        threaded THROUGH one body is the thing being avoided, because then the two paths
        share every line and drift only in the branches nobody reads. A further
        difference goes here -- with a line saying why, and with its own error budget.

        THE THIRD DIFFERENCE: the body can run on a HEAD RANGE. Branch-parallel Ulysses
        gives each linear rank all rows of `heads` = slice(a, b) heads, plus `beta`,
        `gate` and `frame_mean` computed by the sequence owner (this rank has no `xv`),
        and `text_beta` for the prompt rows. Every parameter read below then takes the
        head slice (conv channels, alpha's up/dt_bias/A_log; the norm weight is per
        head_dim and shared by all heads, so it stays whole); the arithmetic is
        unchanged, so a full run's output[:, a:b] equals the sliced run to fp32 rounding
        (the compiled kernels re-tune for the sliced shapes, which changes reduction
        order). None of it exists in `_readout`.
