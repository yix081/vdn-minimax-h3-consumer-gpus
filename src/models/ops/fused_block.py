"""Inference-only kernels for the pointwise parts of a DiT block: the two pre-norms,
the two AdaLN affines, the two gated residual adds, and the feed-forward's SwiGLU
activation.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every one of those steps is pure elementwise work on the
[~105k, 5376] residual stream -- over 1 GiB per bf16 copy. Written the obvious way they
run as seven separate kernels that between them move several times more memory than
the arithmetic needs. Nothing here is clever: it is the same expressions, handed to
inductor in one piece so the intermediates stay in registers -- one read and one write
per stage.

The AdaLN affine is the worst of them: `scale.index_select(0, adaln_indices)` and
`shift.index_select(0, adaln_indices)` each materialise a full-size gathered copy of a
table with a handful of distinct rows, purely so a broadcast can consume it. Fused, the
gather happens per element in the kernel and never reaches memory.

INFERENCE ONLY, and installed by `hybrid_transform.set_inference_mode`. Two reasons it is
not simply the block's forward:

  * `dynamic=False`. The whole point is that inductor gets to specialise on the real
    shape; a training run varies caption length every step and would recompile.
  * NOT BITWISE. Inductor holds the RMSNorm reciprocal and the affine chain in fp32 and
    rounds once at the store, where eager rounds after every op. Same direction and the
    same size as the fused QK-norm+rope (see _qk_prep) -- an improvement in accuracy,
    but a difference, and a training step must not silently take it.

The eager bodies stay here next to the fused ones as the reference, so what is being
claimed equal is visible in one screen.
