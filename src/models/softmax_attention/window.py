    chunk == 0  FRAME mode: the centered window |t_q - t_k| <= radius.

    chunk == K  CHUNK-ALIGNED mode ("c<radius>"): frame t belongs to chunk t // K and
        sees whole chunks [c - radius, c + radius]. The window is a property of the
        CHUNK, not of the frame — frames 5 and 9 (both chunk 1, K=5) get the identical
        window — which is the point: the VAE encodes every K latent frames
        independently, so a frame that sees only part of a neighbouring chunk sees a
        fragment of a unit that was never coded as separable. c1 therefore guarantees
        every frame a complete previous, current and next chunk.

        A frame window cannot express this. Centering radius r on t gives frame 5 the
        span [5-r, 5+r] and frame 9 the span [9-r, 9+r]; whatever r is, one of them
        straddles a chunk boundary. Alignment is what is being bought here, not width.

        The last chunk is short when K does not divide num_frames (102 = 20*5 + 2) and
        that is fine — it is still a whole chunk, just a smaller one.
