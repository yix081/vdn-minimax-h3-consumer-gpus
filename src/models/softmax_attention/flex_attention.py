    TRAINING (inference=False) — dynamic=True, Triton, ONE graph for every sequence
    length. dynamic=False is a landmine here. The packed length varies with the caption,
    so a static compile makes a fresh cache entry per length; torch._dynamo's
    recompile_limit is 8, and on the 9th distinct length it stops compiling and runs
    flex_attention EAGER, which materialises the full score matrix (56 x ~104k^2 x 2 B).
    A short benchmark cannot catch this — 3-4 steps see at most 4 distinct lengths.

    `fail_on_recompile_limit_hit` matters most, because the degradation is silent by
    construction: dynamo logs a warning and keeps running, and what surfaces is an OOM
    with no obvious connection to shapes. As an exception, an unanticipated shape stops
    the run instead of quietly falling off the fast path.

    INFERENCE (inference=True) — dynamic=False and CuteDSL/FlashAttention-4. At the
    real shape and mask this is ~1.6x faster per layer than the Triton path: the
    block-sparse FLASH kernel realises the sparsity almost perfectly, so its throughput
    approaches the dense FA4 kernel's.

    Why the two cannot be one. FLASH refuses a BlockMask under a dynamic compile:

        NYI: score_mod or mask_mod captures a dynamic scalar (SymInt/SymFloat). The
        FLASH backend cannot inline symbolic values into the CuteDSL template.

    and the symbols are inside the BlockMask itself (its Q_LEN, KV_LEN, block sizes), so
    rewriting our mask_mod's captures as device tensors does not help. dynamic=False is
    the only door, and it is a door only inference can walk through: one render process
    renders one prompt, so seq_len is fixed for its whole life, while training brings a
    new caption every batch. The restriction is narrower than "FLASH needs static
    shapes" — the DENSE FA4 teacher runs under a dynamic compile, because with no mask
    there is no template to inline into.

    The static variant keeps the recompile limit that guards the dynamic one, so a
    process that does see 9 distinct lengths raises rather than degrading. Callers
    downgrade on that (see window_softmax_flex).

    transposing copies per layer (q, k, v) plus one on the way out: the output inherits
    q's strides, so `.transpose` back to [T, H, d] is a view and the gate/to_out
