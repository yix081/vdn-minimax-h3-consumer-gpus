"""Repository-relative paths and the Hub fallback for weights.

A ModelSpec's `base.source`, a config's `checkpoint` / `base_source` / `vae_source` and
the render default are all written relative to the repository root
(`ckpts/<name>`), so an artifact carries no machine-specific path. When such a
directory is not present locally it is fetched from the Hub (`HF_WEIGHTS_REPO`, the
same layout) into the huggingface cache and used from there. Absolute paths pass through.
